The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascade:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container p {
  background-color: lightcoral; /* This will override the parent's background-color */
}

.container p.special {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This should override the previous, but might not always work as expected */
}

/* In some cases, if other selectors have higher specificity, even though the rule is placed below, it might override the above*/
p.special {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

The unexpected behavior can arise if there are other selectors with higher specificity targeting the `.special` element, which would override the `.container p.special` rule even if this rule is placed after the other higher specificity rules.

This issue highlights that while the cascade generally works top-to-bottom, CSS specificity plays a crucial role. A seemingly simple style declaration might not apply due to a higher-specificity selector somewhere else in the stylesheet.
